# Design

I spent most of my calories on the functionality of the site, so the design is pretty simple. I did want it to look good on different sized devices, so I added media queries to modify the page margins and location of subheadings for mobile-sized browsers. I used some custom fonts including a Lord of the Rings font for the title and some subheadings as well as the Google Font "Bilbo" for one of the subheadings.

I put some custom styling into the responses that are displayed when typing into the guess inputs. I'm pretty happy with their look and simplicity overall.
